## Asynchronous I/O in Python
Asynchronous I/O allows a program to handle multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for each task to complete before starting the next one. This can be particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like network requests, file I/O, or any situation where a task spends a lot of time waiting.

## asyncio Library
The asyncio library in Python provides tools to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It's designed to handle asynchronous operations by running them in an event loop.

## Key Concepts
Coroutine: A function defined with async def. It can use await to pause its execution until the awaited task is done.
Event Loop: The core of every asyncio application. It runs asynchronous tasks and callbacks.
Task: A coroutine wrapped in a way that allows it to be executed concurrently.
